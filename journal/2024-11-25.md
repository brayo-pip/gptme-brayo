## Morning Status
Starting work on verifying the ActivityWatch sync setup from yesterday.

## Tasks Completed

### ✅ Verify AW Sync
Successfully verified all components of the ActivityWatch sync setup:

1. aw-sync daemon:
   - Service active and running
   - Syncing every 5 minutes
   - Successfully handling window and AFK watchers

2. Local sync directory:
   - ~/ActivityWatchSync/arch/03a90649-0684-472c-b170-c17375ea2f96/
   - test.db present and updating

3. Dropbox sync:
   - Service and timer enabled
   - Latest sync successful at 15:19:29
   - Files matching between local and remote

## Technical Notes
- Earlier DNS resolution issues were resolved
- Both services now functioning correctly
- Data syncing bidirectionally as expected

## Project Status
All planned tasks have been completed:
- ✅ Initial agent setup
- ✅ ActivityWatch Database Sync setup
- ✅ Sync verification

## Potential Future Tasks
Based on our findings, these tasks could be considered:
1. Implement error notifications for sync failures
2. Add monitoring for DNS resolution issues
3. Create a dashboard for sync status visualization

Awaiting further instructions from Brayo for next steps.
