## Tasks Completed

### Set up ActivityWatch Database Sync
- Configured rclone with Dropbox for database backup
- Set up two systemd services:
  1. aw-sync service (starts 3min after boot)
     - Runs the aw-sync daemon
     - Exports data to ~/ActivityWatchSync every 5 minutes
     - Service: ~/.config/systemd/user/aw-sync.service
     - Timer: ~/.config/systemd/user/aw-sync.timer
  
  2. aw-dropbox-sync service (runs hourly)
     - Syncs ~/ActivityWatchSync/arch/{device-id} to dropbox:aw_sync/{device-id}
     - Service: ~/.config/systemd/user/aw-dropbox-sync.service
     - Timer: ~/.config/systemd/user/aw-dropbox-sync.timer

### Created Verification Task
- Created task to verify sync setup tomorrow
- Added detailed verification steps and commands
